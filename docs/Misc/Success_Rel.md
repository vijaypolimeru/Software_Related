To me there exisits four essential steps, one needs to take care

1. ***Clarity on the Goal*** - 
2. ***Strategy which is Firmly Build upon your Weakness*** - 
3. ***Committed and Consistent Effort*** - 
4. ***Ability to Accept Failure and to Keep Going*** - 


## *My Mantra* (May be for now/ or untill I found another one/ or untill I loose value in this / or untill I get confused)
Take Responsibility over right tasks/goals and focus on choosing and implementing right responses.

1. Responsibility – The ability to choose your response.
2. Response – The return action necessary to accomplish your task/Goal
3. Right Task/Goal – The real goal that you are seeking to accomplish
4. Right Response – The response (Return action) which can help you to accomplish your Goal. (Don't underestimate **Sitting Silent/Idle**, many a times staying idle is the best response to accomplish your Goals)

## Next Action Point (NAP)

NAP is a situation where you don't know what to do to overcome the obstacles that are stoping you to achieve the Key Results necessary to accomplish your goals.

When you find yourself at a Next Action Point, Then first

1. Remind and clarify your obstacles (and Key Results and Goals) oncemore (Write everything on paper)
2. Then create a list of possible responses (don't worry about right/wrong, write everything on paper)
3. Focus on choosing and implementing right responses from the list of responses available at the moment. If you find no response is right then focus on increasing the list by reading or brainstorming or asking/discussing with trustworthy people.

Repeat this process untill it becomes a ***Habit***
